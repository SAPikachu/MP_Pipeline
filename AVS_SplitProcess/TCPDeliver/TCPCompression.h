/*******************************************************************************
  This is a generic compression class for implementing different types of
  compression.

  Each compression type has it's own class and TCPCompression as it's 
  superclass.

  Basicly for compression and decompression you:

  - Create an instance of the compression class.
  - Call CompressImage or DeCompressImage with your data.
  - The result is placed in the "dst" pointer.
  - The number of bytes in the output is returned by the function.
  - If "inplace" is false you must free the dst data using "_aligned_free".
    - otherwise dst is the same as your source.

  You can get a unique ID of the compression type, by reading "compression_type".
